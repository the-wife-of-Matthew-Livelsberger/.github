## The Rise of Attention on Sara, His Ex-Wife

In the wake of the shocking Tesla Cybertruck blast, all eyes are on Matthew Livelsberger’s ex-wife, **Sara**, with discussions about her personal life. Hailing from Playa del Carmen, Mexico, Sara is a social worker and a registered Democrat.

While the exact timeline of their relationship has not been disclosed, reports suggest that it began in 2015. However, over time, their relationship became tumultuous, with heated arguments, allegations of infidelity, and possible abuse towards Sara.

The couple separated between 2016 and 2017. Allegedly, both Sara and Matthew Livelsberger have since remarried and have children with their respective partners. The details of Matthew’s current wife haven’t been fully disclosed, but rumors suggest he might have been married to **Jennifer Anne Davis**.

In the days leading up to the explosion, there were rumors of infidelity, and his current partner had left prior to the attack. Additionally, a screenshot of his conversation with an ex-girlfriend resurfaced, hinting at a possible affair.

However, the public’s focus remains on Matthew’s ex-wife, Sara, linking her to the incident. No official statement from authorities has suggested her involvement in the Cybertruck blast.

## Was Matthew Livelsberger Just a Pawn in a Bigger Game?

As more details emerge, various theories have surfaced suggesting that Matthew Livelsberger could have been a scapegoat in a larger plot. Some people have speculated that Sara could have been the mastermind behind the attack, pointing to her political affiliation and ties to the military.

Sara’s affiliation as a Democrat contrasts with Matthew's position as a Trump supporter. Additionally, her current husband, a Special Forces member and Intelligence/Operations director, has raised eyebrows. People are linking her to the incident due to a social media post suggesting her husband's support of Jihad extremists.

Theories regarding Matthew’s ex-wife and current wife continue to circulate, but the bigger picture remains focused on Matthew himself. A decorated **U.S. Army Master Sergeant** and **Green Beret**, Matthew had a career spanning 19 years.

## Matthew Livelsberger's Connection to the Cybertruck Incident

Before the attack, Matthew Livelsberger was on break from duty in Germany and had rented a **Tesla Cybertruck** from Turo. This revelation has intensified the situation, as the driver involved in the New Orleans attack, **Shamsud-Din Jabbar**, had also used the same rental service.

Moreover, reports suggest that both Matthew Livelsberger and Shamsud-Din Jabbar served at **Fort Liberty** and had deployments in Afghanistan in 2009. The coincidence of these attacks and the military background of both men has sparked numerous unanswered questions.

As of now, no definitive links to extremist ideologies have been established, and there is no evidence to suggest that their actions were coordinated. However, the conspiracy theories continue to grow.

## Was Matthew Livelsberger Already Lifeless Before the Blast?

Some online commentators wonder whether Matthew might have already been lifeless before the explosion. An official statement revealed that Matthew had self-harmed just before the **Cybertruck** burst into flames. However, skeptics argue that someone might have placed his body in the truck and set it on autopilot to drive to the hotel.

This theory is fueled by the fact that Matthew, a vocal **Trump supporter**, chose to carry out the attack near the **Trump International Hotel**, which doesn’t seem to align with the initial understanding of the incident.

The investigation is still ongoing, and authorities are working hard to uncover the truth. The public remains eager to know whether this was a political statement, a personal vendetta, or something else entirely.
